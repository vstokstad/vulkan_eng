<ul>

<b>TEXTURES</b>
<li>TextureSampler should be moved from swapchain to renderer.</li>
<li>Model-components should load and keep track of its own textures.</li>
<li>Map several textures to larger models</li>

<b>PHYSICS</b>
<li>Physics rotations needs to be properly remapped to rendering space</li>
<li>Maybe skip all RB and use only collider bodies and handle "physics" my self, let library do collisions</li>
<li>Use physics ecs instead of updating everything in for loops.</li>

<b>LIGHTING</b>
<li>Specular lights / blinn-phong</li>
</ul>
